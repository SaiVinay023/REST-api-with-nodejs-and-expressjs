**Project Overview
**This REST API project is built using Node.js and Express.js, designed to provide a structured backend solution for managing user data. It features a modular architecture with separate controllers and routes, allowing for easy scalability and maintainability. Utilizing JSON for data handling, the API ensures efficient communication between the server and client applications.
Technical Implementation Methodology
Project Setup:

Initialized a Node.js project using npm, creating a package.json file to manage dependencies.
Directory Structure:

Organized the project into distinct directories:
controllers: Contains the logic for handling requests and responses.
routes: Defines the API endpoints and maps them to the respective controller functions.
node_modules: Automatically generated by npm to manage installed packages.
Core Components:

Express.js: Utilized Express to set up the server and manage routing. Implemented middleware for parsing JSON requests.
Controllers: Created modular controller functions that handle CRUD operations for user data, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.
Data Storage:

users.json: Used a JSON file to simulate a database for user data, allowing easy data manipulation during development.
API Endpoints:

Defined RESTful API endpoints for user operations:
GET /users: Retrieve all users.
GET /users/:id: Retrieve a specific user by ID.
POST /users: Create a new user.
PUT /users/:id: Update an existing user.
DELETE /users/:id: Remove a user.
Error Handling:

Implemented error handling middleware to manage and respond to errors gracefully, providing informative responses for failed requests.
Testing:

Tested API endpoints using tools like Postman to ensure functionality and correctness of responses.
Documentation:

Provided clear comments within the code and structured the project for readability, making it easy for other developers to understand and contribute.
This methodology ensures a robust, scalable, and maintainable REST API solution.
